# Weighted Average Inventory Calculator
I wanted to implement what I had learned in my accounting class into programming. So I made a simple calculator that determines the cost of goods sold (cogs), gross margin, and ending inventory in a perpetual inventory system using the weighted average method in financial accounting.
I created this calculator to help me learn Java for my upcoming course.
